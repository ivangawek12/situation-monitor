# Situation Monitor

**Situation Monitor** is a local-first Python platform that ingests and visualizes **geopolitical and cyber-threat intelligence events**, enriched with automated risk scoring and offline geolocation.

It is designed for analysts and researchers who need operational visibility of global situations — without relying on cloud services or external APIs.

## Core Capabilities

- 🌍 **Geopolitical + CTI OSINT ingestion**
- 📍 **Offline geolocation** using a global GeoNames gazetteer
- 📊 **Severity, confidence and priority scoring**
- 📈 **Spike detection and situational clustering by tags**
- 🗺️ **Dark-mode interactive world map (OpenStreetMap)**
- 🧠 **Local-first architecture powered by DuckDB**
- ⚙️ Fully reproducible and deployable offline

---

## Dashboard Overview

The monitor provides:

- A real-time event feed
- A timeline of activity over configurable time windows
- A tag-based “Active Situations” ranking
- Spike detection for anomalous event behavior
- An interactive dark map showing event geolocation and intensity
- Rankings of sources and tags for situational awareness

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment:

git clone https://github.com/yourname/situation-monitor.git
cd situation-monitor
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Run ingestion to populate or refresh the local database:
    python ingest.py
2. Launch the Streamlit dashboard:
    streamlit run app.py

## Data Model
Each event includes:

Field	Description
event_id	Unique event identifier
ts	Timestamp
domain	geopolitics / cti
title	Event title
summary	Event summary
source_name	Feed source
priority	Computed priority score
severity	Computed severity score
confidence	Computed confidence score
geo_label	Geolocated city / region
geo_country	ISO country
geo_lat / geo_lon	Coordinates
tags	Situation classification

## Use Cases
- Cyber Threat Intelligence monitoring
- Geopolitical risk tracking
- Brand protection and fraud awareness
- OSINT research and correlation
- Intelligence training and anomaly detection

## Philosophy
This monitor follows an intelligence-driven design:
- Structured ingestion
- Quantitative prioritization
- Visual situational encoding
- Low noise / high signal
- Analyst-centric UX

Built for analysts who think in patterns, not in headlines.
